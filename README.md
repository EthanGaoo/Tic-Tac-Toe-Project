# Tic Tac Toe
## Indroduction

This Tic Tac Toe game is the first solo project of my soft engineering career. During this project, I learnt how to turn project logic into code and use CSS to decorate the project.Here is the [brief.](https://gist.github.com/wofockham/8e959d5cfe7d120f1157)

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Built with

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Approach

At the very beginning of the project, I created a 3x3 grid to make the game's core functionality run successfully. It is the bone structure of the whole project.

After that, I decided to add different modes into the game like `PLAYER VS PLAYER` and `PLAYER VS AI`. I made a main menu in `index-menu.html` for player to choose.

Base on the previous step, 5x5 mode is added.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Gameplay / Features

I set a timer in each mode, when the first player does not take an action in 5 seconds, it will show an alert `YOU ARE OUT OF TIME`
All players' names can be customizable in different modes. Players can put their names in `PLAYER VS PLAYER` mode to choose who is `X` or `O` and in `PLAYER VS AI` mode to choose `X` for the player's name.The game will show the winner's name in the end.

## Possible future feature additions

* In `PLAYER VS AI` mode , allow player the AI `EASY MODE` or `HARD MODE`
* Trying to put every options in one page.
* Add audio into the game when player clicks and result comes out
* Making `X` and `O` customizble. Player can choose emoji instead of single `X` or `O`
